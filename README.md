## How to Integrate Economic Impact Data (Not in WiDS Folder)

### The Solution: Live Economic Data Integration

## Step 1: Identify External Economic Data Sources

Instead of using static CSV files from the WiDS data exports, we access live APIs that provide real-time economic and demographic data:

- Government APIs (census.gov, data.gov/ed)
- Business databases (Google Places API)
- State/Local economic APIs

## Step 2: HTTP API Calls for Economic Data

Rather than reading local files with `pd.read_csv()`, we make HTTP requests to external economic data services:

```python
# Instead of this (local file):
df = pd.read_csv("local_file.csv")

# We do this (external API):
response = requests.get("https://api.census.gov/data/2021/cbp?get=ESTAB&for=zipcode:90210")
economic_data = response.json()
```

## Step 3: Real-Time Economic Data Retrieval

For each fire incident in `geo_events_geoevent.csv`, we:

1. Extract the fire's coordinates (lat/lng)
2. Get zipcode from coordinates using reverse geocoding
   - **ðŸ’¡ Student Tip:** If you don't want to use the API approach, you can extract zipcodes directly from the address column in `geo_events_geoevent.csv` using regex: `r'\b(\d{5})(?:-\d{4})?(?:\s*,\s*USA)?\b'` 
3. Make live API calls to economic services using zipcode
4. Retrieve current economic conditions (business patterns, demographics, infrastructure)
5. Add this economic data as new fields to the fire record

## Step 4: Economic Data Integration Process

```python
def enrich_fire_with_economic_data(fire_record):
    lat = fire_record['lat']
    lng = fire_record['lng']
    zipcode = get_zipcode_from_coordinates(lat, lng)
    
    # Call external economic APIs
    tourism_data = get_tourism_exposure_data(lat, lng, zipcode)
    business_data = get_small_business_data(lat, lng, zipcode)
    evacuation_data = get_evacuation_constraint_data(lat, lng, zipcode)
    education_data = get_childcare_dependency_data(lat, lng, zipcode)
    
    # Calculate composite Impact Index and component scores
    impact_metrics = calculate_impact_index(tourism_data, business_data, education_data)
    
    # Add economic data to fire record
    # Tourism & Hospitality Exposure
    fire_record['lodging_establishments_count'] = tourism_data['lodging_establishments_count']
    fire_record['tourism_employment'] = tourism_data['tourism_employment']
    fire_record['tourism_dependency_index'] = tourism_data['tourism_dependency_index']
    fire_record['tourism_source'] = tourism_data['source']
    
    # Small Business Vulnerability
    fire_record['small_business_pct'] = business_data['small_business_pct']
    fire_record['small_business_source'] = business_data['source']
    
    # Evacuation Constraints
    fire_record['households_no_vehicle_pct'] = evacuation_data['households_no_vehicle_pct']
    fire_record['elderly_population_pct'] = evacuation_data['elderly_population_pct']
    fire_record['mobility_impaired_pct'] = evacuation_data['mobility_impaired_pct']
    fire_record['evacuation_source'] = evacuation_data['source']
    
    # Childcare Dependency
    fire_record['k12_schools_count'] = education_data['k12_schools_count']
    fire_record['k12_student_density'] = education_data['k12_student_density']
    fire_record['caregiver_employment_pct'] = education_data['caregiver_employment_pct']
    fire_record['childcare_source'] = education_data['source']
    
    # Composite Metrics (from calculate_impact_index function)
    fire_record['economic_impact_index'] = impact_metrics['economic_impact_index']
    fire_record['tourism_exposure_score'] = impact_metrics['tourism_exposure_score']
    fire_record['small_business_vulnerability_score'] = impact_metrics['small_business_vulnerability_score']
    fire_record['evacuation_constraints_score'] = impact_metrics['evacuation_constraints_score']
    fire_record['educational_disruption_score'] = impact_metrics['educational_disruption_score']
    fire_record['zipcode'] = zipcode
    
    return fire_record
```

## Step 5: Handling External Dependencies

- **Internet Connection:** Required for API access
- **API Rate Limits:** Built-in delays between calls
- **Error Handling:** Graceful failure when APIs are unavailable
- **Authentication:** Ready for API keys when needed
- **Zipcode Resolution:** Automatic coordinate-to-zipcode conversion

## Key Difference from WiDS Data

### External Economic API Data (Live Sources):
- `api.census.gov` - Current business patterns and demographics
- `maps.googleapis.com` - Real-time business establishment data
- `api.data.gov/ed` - School location and enrollment data
- HTTP requests with `requests.get()`

## Practical Implementation

1. **EconomicDataConnector class** - Manages HTTP sessions and economic API calls
2. **API-specific methods** - `get_tourism_exposure_data()`, `get_small_business_data()`, etc.
3. **Integration workflow** - Takes fire coordinates, gets zipcode, calls economic APIs, returns enriched data
4. **Error handling** - Continues processing even if external APIs fail

### How It Works in Practice:

**Input:** Fire at coordinates (38.3861, -122.7693)

**Economic API calls:**
- Zipcode: `GET https://api.bigdatacloud.net/data/reverse-geocode-client?latitude=38.3861&longitude=-122.7693`
- Tourism: `GET https://api.census.gov/data/2021/cbp?get=ESTAB&for=zipcode:95472`
- Business: `GET https://api.census.gov/data/2021/cbp?get=ESTAB&for=zipcode:95472`
- Demographics: `GET https://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acs5?get=B08301&for=zipcode:95472`
- Schools: `GET https://api.data.gov/ed/v1/schools?zip=95472`

**Output:** Fire record enriched with economic impact data and composite Impact Index

## Composite Impact Index Calculation

### Formula (Higher = Worse Disruption Risk):

```
ImpactIndex = 
    0.50 * TourismExposure +
    0.30 * SmallBusinessVulnerability +
    0.20 * EducationalDisruption
```

### Weight Assignment Rationale:

**50% Tourism Exposure** - **Highest Priority**
- **Direct Economic Impact:** Tourism revenue loss is immediate and measurable
- **Recovery Time:** Tourism-dependent areas take longer to fully recover
- **Cascade Effects:** Hotel closures affect local businesses and services that depend on tourism
- **Seasonal Vulnerability:** Many tourism areas have limited off-season revenue

**30% Small Business Vulnerability** - **High Priority**
- **Financial Fragility:** Small businesses have less cash buffer for closures
- **Permanent Closures:** Many small businesses never reopen after disasters
- **Local Employment:** Small businesses are major local employers
- **Economic Diversity:** Loss of small businesses reduces economic resilience

**20% Educational Disruption** - **Moderate Priority**
- **Indirect Impact:** School closures affect productivity, not direct revenue
- **Temporary Nature:** Educational disruption ends when schools reopen
- **Workforce Impact:** Parents missing work reduces economic output
- **Secondary Effect:** Less critical than direct business revenue loss

### Component Definitions:

- **TourismExposure** (0-1): Tourism dependency (70%) + normalized lodging establishments count (30%)
- **SmallBusinessVulnerability** (0-1): Small business percentage (1-19 employees / total businesses)
- **EducationalDisruption** (0-1): Student density + caregiver employment + school count

## Output Data Schema

### New Fields Added to Fire Records:

#### Tourism & Hospitality Exposure:
- `lodging_establishments_count` - Total lodging establishments
  - **Data Sources:** Google Places API (hotels/motels within radius)
  - **Economic Relevance:** More establishments mean greater economic exposure to tourism disruption and higher potential for business closures
- `tourism_employment` - Employment in accommodation sector (output field name)
  - **Internal Variable:** `lodging_employment` (from Census NAICS 721)
  - **Data Sources:** US Census County Business Patterns (NAICS 721)
  - **Economic Relevance:** Direct measure of workforce at risk of job loss during evacuations and tourism disruption
- `tourism_dependency_index` - Tourism employment ratio (0-1)
  - **Calculation:** `tourism_dependency_index = (lodging_employment / total_employment)`
  - **Data Sources:** US Census County Business Patterns (NAICS 721) for lodging employment, total employment by zipcode
  - **Economic Relevance:** Higher dependency means the local economy is more vulnerable to tourism sector disruption
- `tourism_source` - "Census Business Patterns + Google Places"

#### Small Business Vulnerability:
- `small_business_pct` - % of businesses that are small businesses (1-19 employees)
  - **Calculation:** `small_business_pct = (small_business_count / total_businesses)`
  - **Data Sources:** US Census County Business Patterns by establishment size (1-19 employees)
  - **Economic Relevance:** Areas with higher percentages of small businesses are more economically vulnerable because small businesses have less financial buffer and are more likely to close permanently during disasters, causing direct economic impact
- `small_business_source` - "Census County Business Patterns"

#### Evacuation Constraints:
- `households_no_vehicle_pct` - % households without vehicle access
  - **Calculation:** `households_no_vehicle_pct = (households_without_vehicle / total_households)`
  - **Data Sources:** US Census American Community Survey (ACS) Table B08301
  - **Economic Relevance:** Households without vehicles require public assistance for evacuation, increasing government costs and reducing workforce mobility
- `elderly_population_pct` - % population 65+
  - **Data Sources:** US Census American Community Survey (ACS) Table B01001
  - **Economic Relevance:** Elderly populations require more assistance during evacuations, increasing emergency response costs and reducing economic productivity
- `mobility_impaired_pct` - % with mobility limitations
  - **Data Sources:** US Census American Community Survey (ACS) Table B18101
  - **Economic Relevance:** Mobility-impaired individuals require specialized evacuation assistance, significantly increasing emergency response costs
- `evacuation_source` - "Census ACS"

#### Childcare Dependency:
- `k12_schools_count` - Schools within 15 miles
  - **Data Sources:** US Department of Education API (school locations)
  - **Economic Relevance:** More schools mean more families affected by closures, requiring parents to miss work and reducing economic productivity
- `k12_student_density` - Students per square mile
  - **Data Sources:** US Department of Education API (enrollment data)
  - **Economic Relevance:** Higher student density indicates more families with children who need care during school closures, forcing parents to miss work
- `caregiver_employment_pct` - % workforce with school-age children
  - **Data Sources:** US Census American Community Survey (family demographics)
  - **Economic Relevance:** Parents with school-age children must miss work to provide childcare during school closures, directly reducing economic output
- `childcare_source` - "US Department of Education + Census"

#### Composite Metrics:

##### **`economic_impact_index` - Composite disruption risk score (0-1)**
- **What it measures:** Overall economic vulnerability of the area to wildfire disruption
- **Formula:** `0.50 Ã— TourismExposure + 0.30 Ã— SmallBusinessVulnerability + 0.20 Ã— EducationalDisruption`
- **Interpretation:**
  - **0.0-0.2:** Low economic disruption risk - area can recover quickly
  - **0.2-0.4:** Moderate economic disruption risk - some businesses may close temporarily
  - **0.4-0.6:** High economic disruption risk - significant business closures expected
  - **0.6-0.8:** Very high economic disruption risk - major economic impact, slow recovery
  - **0.8-1.0:** Extreme economic disruption risk - severe economic devastation
- **Economic Relevance:** Single score for emergency responders to prioritize resource allocation

##### **`tourism_exposure_score` - Tourism exposure component (0-1)**
- **What it measures:** How dependent the local economy is on tourism and hospitality
- **Calculation Formula:** `(tourism_dependency_index Ã— 0.7) + (normalized_lodging_establishments Ã— 0.3)`
  - `tourism_dependency_index` = lodging_employment / total_employment (from Census NAICS 721)
  - `normalized_lodging_establishments` = min(1.0, lodging_establishments_count / 50.0) (from Google Places)
- **Note:** `lodging_employment` is the internal variable name; output field is `tourism_employment`
- **Higher score means:** More lodging establishments = Higher revenue loss during evacuations
- **Economic Impact:** Tourism-dependent areas lose immediate revenue and may not recover fully
- **Recovery Time:** Tourism areas typically take 6-18 months to fully recover

##### **`small_business_vulnerability_score` - Small business vulnerability component (0-1)**
- **What it measures:** What percentage of businesses in the area are small businesses (1-19 employees)
- **Calculation Formula:** `small_business_pct` (direct percentage from Census)
  - `small_business_pct` = small_business_count / total_businesses
- **Higher score means:** Higher percentage of small businesses = Higher economic vulnerability
- **Economic Impact:** Areas with more small businesses are more vulnerable because small businesses have less financial buffer and are more likely to close permanently during disasters
- **Recovery Time:** Small business closures are often permanent, reducing local economic diversity

##### **`educational_disruption_score` - Educational disruption component (0-1)**
- **What it measures:** How much school closures would impact local economic productivity
- **Calculation Formula:** `(normalized_student_density Ã— 0.4) + (caregiver_employment_pct Ã— 0.4) + (normalized_school_count Ã— 0.2)`
  - `normalized_student_density` = min(1.0, student_density / 100.0) (from Education API)
  - `caregiver_employment_pct` = parents_with_school_children / total_employment (from Census)
  - `normalized_school_count` = min(1.0, school_count / 20.0) (from Education API)
- **Higher score means:** More families with children = More parents missing work
- **Economic Impact:** School closures force parents to miss work, reducing economic output
- **Recovery Time:** Educational disruption affects productivity until schools reopen

##### **`evacuation_constraints_score` - Evacuation constraints component (0-1)**
- **What it measures:** How difficult it would be to evacuate the population during a wildfire
- **Calculation Formula:** `(households_no_vehicle_pct Ã— 0.4) + (elderly_population_pct Ã— 0.3) + (mobility_impaired_pct Ã— 0.3)`
  - `households_no_vehicle_pct` = households_without_vehicle / total_households (from Census ACS)
  - `elderly_population_pct` = population_65_plus / total_population (from Census ACS)
  - `mobility_impaired_pct` = population_with_mobility_limitations / total_population (from Census ACS)
- **Higher score means:** More vulnerable population = Higher evacuation assistance needs
- **Economic Impact:** Higher evacuation costs for emergency services and longer clearance times
- **Note:** This score is calculated and available but not included in the main Impact Index formula
